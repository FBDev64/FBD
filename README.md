<br>Made with Nano 😎 and Arch.

## Compile
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FBDev64/FBD && cd FBD
chmod +x launcher.sh
```
Then run the `launcher.sh` file.

The only dependency is Gum. You need it in order to run FBD correctly, else you'll get an error. Download it with brew or your package manager.

```bash
# MacOS and Linux
brew install gum

# Arch (BTW)
sudo pacman -S gum
```
